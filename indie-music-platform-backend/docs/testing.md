# 🧪 Testing Strategy

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Indie Music Platform Backend, including test organization, execution methods, and CI/CD integration.

## 🏗️ Test Structure

### Test Categories

```
tests/
├── api/                    # API endpoint tests
├── services/              # Business logic tests
├── security/              # Security vulnerability tests
├── edge_cases/            # Boundary and edge case tests
├── validation/            # Data validation tests
├── comprehensive/         # Full integration tests
└── mocks/                # Mock data and fixtures
```

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Service interaction testing
- **Security Tests**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerability testing framework
- **Boundary Tests**: Edge cases and limit validation
- **Validation Tests**: Input sanitization and data integrity

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Test Configuration
Tests are configured via `pyproject.toml` with:
- Coverage settings (70% minimum threshold)
- Test markers for categorization
- Async test support
- Warning filters

### Environment Setup
```bash
export TESTING=True
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///:memory:
export SECRET_KEY=test_secret_key
export FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=tests/mocks/firebase_credentials.json
```

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Local Execution
```bash
# Quick test suite
./scripts/run-tests.sh --quick

# Full test suite
./scripts/run-tests.sh --full

# Security tests only
./scripts/run-tests.sh --security-only

# With coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### CI/CD Integration
Tests are automatically executed on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Daily security scans
- Weekly coverage reports

## 📊 Coverage & Quality

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum: 70% code coverage
- Target: 80%+ for production readiness
- Branch coverage enabled

### Quality Metrics
- Code formatting: Black
- Import sorting: isort
- Linting: flake8
- Type checking: mypy
- Security: bandit

## 🔒 Security Testing

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage
Framework implemented for:
- Injection attacks
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive data exposure
- XML external entities
- Broken access control
- Security misconfiguration
- Cross-site scripting
- Insecure deserialization
- Known vulnerabilities
- Insufficient logging

### Mock Services
- Firebase authentication mocking
- S3 storage mocking
- Stripe payment mocking
- Database isolation

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

### Automated Reporting
- HTML coverage reports
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks
- Quality metrics

### Monitoring
- Daily security vulnerability scans
- Weekly coverage trend analysis
- Performance regression detection

This testing strategy ensures reliable, secure, and maintainable code through comprehensive automated validation.
